            <ul><u><b>Professional Career</b></u>
                <li>I graduated from Texas A&M in 2018 with a BA in Anthropology, and I always thought law school was on the horizon.</li>
                <li>Got a job as a legal assistant for a few months and immediately I realized <em>I've made a huge mistake</em>.</li>
                <li>A friend from college helped land me a job at her current company, and I became a sourcer for various tech companies, and eventually moved up to full desk recruiting.</li>
                <li>After 3 years working with some of the most encouraging, helpful, and considerate coworkers you could ever ask for, I decided this wasn't where I wanted to take my career.</li>
                <li>But it was <em>because of</em> my previous job that I even knew what coding was!! I didn't even know JavaScript and Java were <em>two different things</em> and now I'm coding in the former (yes, this website has JS!!)</li>
            </ul>
